I personally developed this tool to auto gernrate generate c# code for our app.


Following are the key points of this tool:

- This tool can auto generate code for c#. 
- This tool can write CRUD Operations, Deisgn UI, Write SQL Queries, Stored procedures, C# Code for MVC Framework and many others.
- We can assign an SQL Server Database to this tool and the tool can auto write CRUD operations for selected tables and it manages everything accordingly. 
- If need to write a sales modules in an C#, we will design a database in SQL Server, create tables for sales modules and it will automatically write code for UI, Views, Controllers, stored procedures, 
- This tool is smart enough to auto link different parents tables to child tables based on constrains

Follow  the demo video and some snaps of the tool. 

It's developed in .net 4.0 and UI developed in DevExpress 13.1
